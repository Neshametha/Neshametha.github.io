                        <p>While attending the ELVTR <b> UX/UI for Gaming</b> class, we were given the chance to reimagine
                            our favorite game out of a small list throughout the course. On that list was Animal Crossing:
                            New Horizons, which is a series I have held dear to my heart since I was small kid playing Wild
                            World on my Nintendo DS (yes, the big brick-y one!). I chose to reimagine it as a competitive
                            entry in the series, where you compete online with other players to see who is the best
                            bug-catcher or angler.</p>

                            <li>Since this project was for a UI/UX class, I was only given a limited amount of games to
                                choose from when working on this project. I got lucky that Animal Crossing was on the list;
                                a lot of the other games I had never played or were not fond of.</li>

                            <li>I used to be a competitive gamer, but this was way back in the day before there were real
                                eSports leagues like there are today. I had to study a lot of modern competitive games to
                                realize what that world was really like.</li>

                            <li>This class was very UX-heavy, which I was less experienced with. Most of my work done in
                                this field has been around UI design.</li>

                                            returning player if they like a more “relaxed” game style.</li>

                        To properly drill down into how a user experience works, I studied the beginning of Animal
                        Crossing: New Horizons. I did this to understand what previous Animal Crossing players expect out
                        of the games and to see the different design and experience elements I could incorporate into my
                        reimagination of the series.

                            <li>As I mentioned, I used to play competitive games but not in any sort of
                                professional capacity. I switched to “cozy games” since I didn’t want to deal
                                with the stress of “having to win”... However, this meant that I never became
                                familiar with the world of eSports. This project helped me understand how
                                different they are from regular online games.</li>

                                that I am proud of, but I never created my portfolio until this course gave me a good
                                outline to work with. It made me more knowledgable about building a UI/UX portfolio in
                                general.</li>
